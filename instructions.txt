setup:
  install Node (nodejs.org)
  run "npm install" in CMD inside this directory
  run "npm install -g typescript"
  run "npm install -g webpack"
  make sure you don't have Typescript conflicts with older versions that get installed with Visual Studio
    to check, run "tsc -v" and it should be >2.0
    this uses TS 2.2 and you may already have TS 1.0 already on your computer if you have VS2013
    check "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs" and see if you have a Typescript folder
    just rename the folder because it probably only has unused older versions of TS

dev:
  you have to have a Typescript compiler running
    in VS Code:
      hit ctrl+shift+b to start the TS compiler
    in CMD:
      run "tsc"
      you're gonna need two CMD windows open
  you also need Webpack running
    open up CMD and run "webpack -w"
